<H1>Propeller Microcontroller vs Arduino</H1>
<p style="text-align: left;">The <a href="https://www.parallax.com/product/p8x32a-q44">Parallax Propeller Microcontroller</a> is THE next generation <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcontroller">microcontroller</a>. The Propeller is quickly replacing the <a href="https://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=381308.0">obsolete Arduino microcontrollers</a> because its processor is <a href="http://forums.parallax.com/discussion/120079/can-you-overclock-the-propeller-with-extreme-measures">more than eight times faster (130MHz vs 16MHz)</a>,&nbsp; has 8 co-processors vs a single processor, and provides significantly more I/O pins â€“ the Propeller has 32 I/O pins and <a href="https://www.parallax.com/product/64000-es">Propeller 2</a> has 64 I/O pins in comparison to only 14 on the <a href="https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-mega-2560-rev3">Arduino microcontroller</a>.</p>
